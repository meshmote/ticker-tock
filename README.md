Idea valuation marketplace using stock price simulation

This was a student project and I'd love some collaboration on to take it farther than what the course required.
The basic concept is to create a virtual stock market of ideas, with a gamified economy that incentivizes
the purchase and sale of simulated shares in start-up based on the idea.  With enough participation, and with a
virtual economy that entrains near real-world stock buying decision behavior (we make them care about the fake money)
the site might create useful crowd-sourced information for potential investors in promising ideas.

Core ideas are described by their authors on a unique web page.  They can be up or downvoted by site visitors.
Additional services or sub-features to the idea can be entered and similarly voted upon.  
A combination of upvotes, site hits, and other criteria (ready for market indicators) may trigger a threshold 
where the idea can "go public"

Gamification elements and other incentives to participation will entice site visitors to buy and sell shares in ideas
that have gone public.  Reports of past price and trading volume can be made available, as well as ratings and comments
left at the idea site.  "Investors" that do well will have readily apparent status in the community, as well as
the opportunity to do something with their accumulated wealth beyond purchasing other stock.

I have made a start at defining the core data structures and that's about it.  I have no clue how to properly curate a project like this, nor how much time I'll be able to contribute, but figure there was no sense leaving it hidden in a private repository, so feel free to play with it if you are so inclined.  Thanks!
